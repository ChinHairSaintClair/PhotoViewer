# Demo
The project can be viewed [here](https://chinhairsaintclair.github.io/PhotoViewer/).

# Config

Before starting the app ensure that a `env.local` file is created.\
This file must contain a `REACT_APP_API_KEY` variable assigned to a valid `unsplash api key`.

# TODO

- Blur hash on photos
- Download button functionality
- Nav button dynamic topic label + adaptive styling
- Error handling & retry functionality
- Responsive styling (eg. photo grid 3 col -> 2)
- Photo pagination trigger irregularity on different screen sizes
- General styling tweaks

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
