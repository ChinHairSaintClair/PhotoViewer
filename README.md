# Demo
The project can be viewed [here](https://chinhairsaintclair.github.io/PhotoViewer/).

# Config

Before starting the app ensure that a `env.local` file is created.\
This file must contain a `REACT_APP_API_KEY` variable assigned to a valid `unsplash api key`.

# TODO

- ~~Photo pagination trigger irregularity on different screen sizes~~
- Error handling & retry functionality
- Abort controllers
- Responsive styling (eg. photo grid 3 col -> 2)
- Lazy loading images
- Blur hash on photos
- Nav button dynamic topic label + adaptive styling
- General styling tweaks
- Download button functionality

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
